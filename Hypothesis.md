# Hypotheses and Dataset Analysis

## Hypotheses

1. **Traveller's Choice Impact**:
   - The rating increases with the number of years a restaurant has received the Traveller's Choice award (e.g., the rating improves if awarded for 3 out of the last 5 years).

2. **Awards and Price Range**:
   - Restaurants with more awards tend to have higher price ranges.

3. **Population and Dietary Options**:
   - Cities with larger populations offer more options for vegan, gluten-free, and other dietary preferences.

4. **Cuisine Variety and Ratings**:
   - As the number of cuisine types offered increases, the food rating tends to decrease.
   - The longer the restaurant's opening hours, the lower the service rating tends to be.

5. **Features and Atmosphere Rating**:
   - Restaurants with more features (e.g., live music, outdoor seating) tend to have higher atmosphere ratings.

## Prediction Task

6. **Predicting Price Range**:
   - Use the hypotheses and relevant features to predict the final price range of restaurants.

## Bonus Task

7. **Bias Analysis**:
   - After preparing the dataset, select 200 rows and evaluate them.
   - Compare the predictions from our model with the actual ratings to identify potential bias in the reviews.
